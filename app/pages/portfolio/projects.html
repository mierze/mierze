        <h3>
            Grouple
        </h3>
        <h5>2014-Present</h5>
        <p>
            Social app for getting together with friends and participating in events. When you propose an event in Grouple, you don't invite friends, you invite your groups. As development continues users will be able to do things like pull up a map of their
            local area and see all public events going on and click to be brought directly to the event profile and get in on the action. Grouple is for promoting socialization outside of the realm of media. Options like minimum and maximum participants,
            recurring events, automating the rescheduling of events to better fit all potential event attendees, and much more make Grouple unique. Users earn badges and levels while using the app, which serves as an extra incentive to get out and active in
            their community. Event messaging, group messaging and user messaging keep communication organized and to the point.
        </p>
        <p>
            Grouple also sports a settings panel that lets you enable or disable both push notifications and email notifications for everything that happens within the app to help keep you in the know to what is going on.

            Android version was made as part of my senior project, I led a team of 3, we practiced agile (SCRUM). Images below are from our android version we presented in May 2015. All of the icons were created in house using Illustrator.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently working on recreating the front-end / back-end of the application via javascript. I will be packaging it together using Phonegap for all devices.

            Technologies used: AngularJS, NodeJS, MySQL DB, Browserify, Cordova, Karma-Jasmine, Gulp
        </p>
        <p>
            GitHub is host to all of the Android and Javascript version code. You can go directly to that

        <h3>Vision-e Scan</h3>
        <p>
            Vision-e Scan, a quick and easy way to scan business cards, qr codes and barcodes to salesforce. Also integrates with eMapping, another Vision-e application. I added multi language support among other functionalities.
        </p>
        <h3>QuickPrint</h3>
        <p>
            Turns an ordinary Xerox scanner into a walk-up kiosk mode for customers. Customers walk up, are instructed through a login process, a session is started. Meter information is grabbed behind the scenes and upon ending finishing working with the
            copier, a receipt is calculated and displayed through the app. Then the customer prints off the receipt and brings it up to the cashier to finish their transaction.
        </p>
        <h3>The Internet</h3>
        <p>
            The first ever application to allow ConnectKey users the opportunity to surf the web via custom bookmarks and quick surfing.
        </p>
        <h4>The Internet Spinoff</h4>
        <p>
            On the way of creating this application I prototyped a browser within a browser angular application that is available on GitHub. It had it's limitations being that many top websites block access to their content from within iFrames.
        </p>
        <h3 id="business-cards">
            Business Cards
        </h3>
        <p>
            An application for Xerox ConnectKey to allow users to enter business cards, print them, email directly to a user on a business card and much more.
        </p>
        <h3>Calendar NG2</h3>
        <p>
            A pure angular2 / javascript calendar plugin, non-dependent on any other resources.
        </p>
        <h3>Disc Golf Website</h3>
        <h5>2014</h5>
        <p>
            Created an interactive disc golf website where users could register, login and record their rounds at various disc golf parks that were put into the server. Features were: course standings where you could sort by a multitude of statistics, and
            personal statistics page breaking down your skills over time. I also connected the site to an open source php forum for the community to use for meet ups at local courses, or just talk about disc golf in general.
