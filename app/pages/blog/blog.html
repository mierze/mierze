    <h3>Ideas for future writes :)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Riding single speed bikes</li>
      <li>My journey writing javascript for Xerox ConnectKey devices</li>
      <li>Lucid dreaming and the power within yourself</li>
      <li>Learning keyboard shortcuts</li>
      <li>Constantly improving</li>
      <li>Ten apps and tools that you need as a developer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It is my thought that I will start this blog, but between a full time job, hobbies and a side biz, I may determine it more reasonable to share some of my experience through my YouTube channel, so look out for that.
