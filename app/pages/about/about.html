    <h3>Me</h3>
    <p>
      I have a passion for javascript and staying on the bleeding edge of responsive web apps. I enjoy sports, nature, music, movies and computer games in my leisure.

      I maintain this website with pure SASS and NG2.

    <h3>Mierze</h3>
    <p>Mierze is short for Mierzejewski, my grandmother's maiden name. She always knew I loved the name and she came to pass in 2013. Since then I've adopted the name as an alias in memory of her.</p>

    <h3>Vegetarian</h3>
    <p>
      Interesting fact about me, I've been a vegetarian since 2009.
