        <h3>Me</h3>
        <p>
            I have a passion for javascript and modern web technologies. You can find me surfing the realms of wonder, testing the latest and greatest the web has to offer. I enjoy and pursue many sports, have a knack for adventure and nature in general, love
            music & movies, and while I haven't had the time for it as of late, get giddy when I can delve into a great computer game.

            I maintain this website with pure scss / ng2. I believe that as advantageous as it is to design ui components with tried and true frameworks, much is to be learned from taking a walk on the wild side. I make sure to exercise that walk.

        <h3>I sometimes go by Mierze</h3>
        <p>Mierze is short for Mierzejewski, my grandmother's maiden name. She always knew I loved the name and she came to pass in 2013. Since then I've adopted the name as an alias in memory of her.</p>

        <h3>Vegetarian</h3>
        <p>
            Interesting fact about me, I've been a vegetarian since 2009 and plan to keep this train rolling to my grave.

        <h3>Travels</h3>
        <p>
            Born in little Rhode Islands, journeyed to Indiana for college, and now nestled into the upstate of South Carolina.
