        <h3>Me</h3>
        <p>
            I have a passion for javascript and modern web technologies. You can find me surfing the realms of wonder, testing the latest and greatest the web has to offer. I enjoy and pursue many sports, have a knack for adventure and nature in general, love
            music & movies, and while I haven't had the time for it as of late, get giddy when I can delve into a great computer game. I'm a beautifully weird creature at heart and enjoy getting better at things, no matter how silly the things may be.

            I maintain this website with pure scss / ng2. I believe that as advantageous as it is to design ui components with tried and true frameworks, much is to be learned from taking a walk on the wild side. I make sure to exercise that walk.

        <h3>I sometimes go by Mierze</h3>
        <p>Mierze is short for Mierzejewski, my grandmother's maiden name. She always knew I loved the name and she came to pass in 2013. Since then I've adopted the name as an alias / middle name, in memory of her.</p>

        <h3>Vegetarian</h3>
        <p>
            Interesting fact about me, I've been a vegetarian since 2009 and plan to keep this train rolling to my grave. Turning vegan is on my roadmap, but my girlfriend would probably kill me.

        <h3>Travels</h3>
        <p>
            Born in little Rhode Islands, journeyed to Indiana for college, and now nestled into the upstate of South Carolina.. until another place claims me.

        <h3>Origins</h3>
        <p>
            I think it was back in the early 2000s, writing my first script to change my name every 100 millisecond during the scoreboards in call of duty to create an animation that got me hooked in programming. There is something indescribable about the art, it stretches the mind.
